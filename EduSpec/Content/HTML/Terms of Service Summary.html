<p class=MsoNormal><b>Terms of Service Summary: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's an attempt at briefly and concisely summarizing some
key points of these Terms of Service in non-legal-jargon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You acknowledge that we cannot, unfortunately, guarantee
that everything will go totally smoothly all the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You are responsible for using our system in a responsible
manner, including uploading only data you should be uploading, abstaining from
malicious or illegal behavior, protecting your password, respecting the
integrity of the system, and respecting its users and its creators (that’s
us!).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After your trial, you’ll be billed monthly. You can cancel anytime
you’d like. If you cancel, your account is archived by default. You can tell us
to delete your data, if you don’t want it archived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the creators and curators of the system, we can change,
add, and remove things, and we can also limit, throttle, suspend, or
discontinue your account if it is deemed necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You are welcome to use our API, but you do so at your own
risk, and your access can be throttled or terminated if it is deemed to be an
abuse/overuse of the tool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have any questions about this stuffy document, please
contact us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember to read below for details -- this section is not a
substitute for the actual Terms of Service, just a brief summary!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following terms and conditions govern all use of the
LessAnnoyingCRM.com website (“Service”) and all content, services and products
available at or through the website. The Service is owned and operated by Less
Annoying CRM, LLC. (“Less Annoying CRM”). The Service is offered subject to
your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions
contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without
limitation, Less Annoying CRM’s Privacy Policy) and procedures that may be
published from time to time on this Site by Less Annoying CRM (collectively, the
“Agreement”). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or
using the Service. By accessing or using any part of the website, you agree to
become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If these terms and
conditions are considered an offer by Less Annoying CRM, acceptance is
expressly limited to these terms. The failure of Less Annoying CRM to exercise
or enforce any right granted in the Terms of Service shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights, and the Terms of Service at all times constitutes the
complete agreement between you and Less Annoying CRM, superceding and prior
agreements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>General Terms</p>

your responsibility. The Service cannot be held responsible or liable for any
loss resulting from the failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>

purposes. You may not use the Service in violation of any laws in your
jurisdiction.</p>

your account, including posted Content. You are also responsible for all
activity and Content posted by others who have accounts under your account.</p>

that your use of the Service will meet your requirements, nor that your use of
the Service will be uninterrupted or free from error. Less Annoying CRM does
not expressly guarantee that any and all defects in the operation of the
Service will be corrected.</p>

right to refuse support for any reason.</p>

third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary
infrastructure (hardware, software, networking, storage, etc.) to run the
Service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abuse of any Less Annoying CRM user or employee (written,
physical, or verbal) will result in immediate account termination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may not use the Service to transmit any malicious code,
such as viruses or worms.</p>

CRM users, Less Annoying CRM reserves the right to deactivate your account
until a time at which your usage can be restored to more normal levels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Less Annoying CRM cannot be held responsible for any
damages, loss, or harm (direct, indirect, incidental, or otherwise) resulting
from a lack of access to the Service, the result of any Content stored in the Service
or the procurement thereof, unauthorized access to your account, data, or
transmissions, or any other matter relating to the Service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Payment and Refunding Terms</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A valid credit card is required to maintain an active
account after the end of the free trial period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All accounts are granted a 30-day free trial upon
registration. After the trial has ended, a notification will be posted on your
account and a grace period of approximately five days will commence. If at the
end of the grace period payment information has not been entered, the account
is subject to archiving or deletion by the Service.</p>

your account at any time and for any reason if it deems such action necessary.

previously detailed. Less Annoying CRM reserves the right to refuse service to
anyone, at any time, and for any reason.</p>

for any changes made to the service, alterations to the pricing of the Service,

over any Content added to your account in Less Annoying CRM, in accordance with
Less Annoying CRM’s privacy policy.</p>

is available via the Service at its discretion. Less Annoying CRM is not
obligated to remove Content from the Service at any time.</p>

through an API (Application Program Interface), you understand that Less
Annoying CRM is not liable for any damages (direct, indirect, incidental, or
otherwise) resulting from the use of the API or third-party products that
access your data via the API.</p>
